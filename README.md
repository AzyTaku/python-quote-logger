# python_quote_logger

This is a basic python quote logger which will log my favorite quotes every 30 seconds

The reason this exists is for me to test and learn about DevOps. 

I have setup helm charts which will be watched by ArgoCD and then deployed into a kubernetes cluster inside an EC2 instance.

Again, its a personal project that needs many improvements but its fun to learn :)
